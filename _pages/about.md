Hi, I’m **Chris Wittman**. I work in Data Center Operations keeping healthcare infrastructure reliable, while automating repetitive work with **Power Automate**, **PowerShell**, and **Python**. I’m comfortable in **Active Directory**, **ServiceNow**, and day-to-day network/print ops.

Outside of work I tinker with homelab projects, build small tools, and study Linux.
